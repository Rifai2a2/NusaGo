The temple is located approximately 100 km southwest of Semarang, 86 km west of Surakarta, and 40 km northwest of Yogyakarta. This stupa-shaped temple was built by Mahayana Buddhists around the 800s AD during the reign of the Syailendra dynasty. Borobudur is the largest Buddhist temple or shrine in the world and one of the largest Buddhist monuments in the world.\nThis monument consists of six square terraces on which are three circular courtyards, the walls are decorated with 2,672 relief panels and originally there were 504 Buddha statues. Borobudur has the most complete and largest collection of Buddhist reliefs in the world. The largest main stupa is in the centre and crowns the building, surrounded by three circular rows of 72 hollow stupas, each containing a statue of Buddha seated cross-legged in the perfect lotus position with the Dharmachakra mudra (hand gesture) (turning the wheel of Dharma). \This monument is a model of the universe and was built as a holy place to glorify Buddha and as a place of pilgrimage to lead humanity from the realm of worldly passions to enlightenment and wisdom according to Buddha's teachings. Pilgrims enter through the eastern side and begin the ritual at the base of the temple by walking in a clockwise circle around the sacred structure, progressing through the three levels of realms in Buddhist cosmology. The three levels are Kāmadhātu (the realm of desire), Rupadhatu (the tangible realm) and Arupadhatu (the immaterial realm). Along the way, pilgrims pass through a series of corridors and staircases, witnessing no fewer than 1,460 beautiful relief panels carved into the walls and balustrades.According to historical evidence, Borobudur was abandoned in the 14th century as the influence of the Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms in Java waned and Islam began to spread. The world became aware of its existence after it was discovered in 1814 by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, then the British Governor-General of Java. Since then, Borobudur has undergone a series of rescue and restoration efforts. The largest restoration project was carried out from 1975 to 1982 with the efforts of the Government of the Republic of Indonesia and UNESCO, after which this historic site was inscribed on the World Heritage List.
